# Explore Coffee Shops in Minsk, Belarus

## Introduction

While it may appear to be easy, opening a coffee shop business requires a lot of insight, research, and planning. Developing your concept, budget, and direction for your coffee shop business will be important.

Why are coffee shops so popular?

Coffee shops are a great place to socialize — statistics show that coffee shops are the most popular place to meet friends. They are also a preferred spot for individuals looking to pass the time reading a book or magazine or surfing the web while consuming a beverage and/or snack.
Coffee shops are a popular place for informal business meetings or for students to catch up on schoolwork. Walk into any popular coffee shop and chances are you will see a realtor reviewing listings with a client or a group of students collaborating on a school project.
Given the above having a great location is obviously very important for attracting customers. If you are franchising or buying an existing business the location is pre-selected but you should still do your research and decide whether the existing or selected location is a good one.

Take the time to find the right building  
To be successful, you need the right location for your coffee shop. You probably want something centrally located, a place where people already gather, and a space that’s conducive to your vision. Jack Wilson, the owner of Radio Coffee and Beer, warns that finding this dream spot won’t happen overnight.  
His team scoured city after city, scouting each location, even going so far as to count pedestrian traffic. He was looking for for a former restaurant space, so he didn’t have to remodel everything from scratch. Finally, one day when he dropped his keys on the sidewalk he noticed a tiny “for sale” sign in a former tavern window. After months of searching, he’d found his spot.

Your coffee shop location and subsequent lease will either maximize your potential business success – or disable it. Your coffee shop business’s location (and the terms of your lease) will play an important role in your overall bottom-line and survival.

So, as you would imagine, you need to start early with this part of your coffee shop business plan and evaluate the best coffee shop location for your business.

Start early and explore multiple coffee shop locations. Talk to neighboring residents and businesses. Determine the traffic flow of the area. Look at other “anchor” businesses, living spaces, and organizations like other restaurants, apartment buildings and dorm rooms, colleges, and office buildings. 

In addition to looking at possible coffee shop locations, work on your coffee shop business plan so that you can readily give your plan and proposal to the owner or property manager of your future location.

Make sure you take the time to count customers. Analyze existing competition and substitutes. In our Complete Coffee Shop Startup Kit, we offer a great discussion on your lease and location – It is highly recommend that you listen to it before you even start looking.

Look at the Existing Market
(Including Your Future Competitors & Substitutes)

What are other coffee shops doing? 

Who are the existing competitors? What will their reaction to your business be? Who are the substitutes in your area? While you may not have direct competitors, the substitutes also play an important role at filling the needs of your customers. Substitutes can include places like IHOP or Subway – or any fast food place that serves coffee.

Examine analytically, but don’t be afraid to use your gut feeling about a specific location either. If you’re not getting a good vibe, then it may not be a good place to start a business there. Balance your gut feeling with a data-driven approach too. Therefore, you should lean hard on – or depend on the math, but trust in your gut feelings too.

Once you find several locations, you can then look at the terms of the lease, count customers, and look at whether the tax and labor laws are favorable to your business (We'll cover that in the next tip!).

Finally, take a moment to examine who your customer base will be and what their “pain points” are. Develop a real understanding of who you customers are and you will be in a better position to succeed.

## Data

to leverage the Foursquare location data to explore or compare neighborhoods 

Foursquare is a technology company that built a massive dataset of location data. What is interesting about Foursquare is that they were very smart about building their dataset. They actually crowd-sourced their data and had people use their app to build their dataset and add venues and complete any missing information they had in their dataset. Currently its location data is the most comprehensive out there, and quite accurate that it powers location data for many popular services like Apple Maps, Uber, Snapchat, Twitter and many others, and is currently being used by over 100,000 developers, and this number is only growing.

Our goal is to explore, segment, and cluster the neighborhoods in Minsk. However, unlike New York, the neighborhood data is not readily available on the internet.

We need to build the code to scrape the following page http://belpost.by/branch/post/otdeleniya-sviazi/

Once the data is in a structured format, we will explore and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto.
